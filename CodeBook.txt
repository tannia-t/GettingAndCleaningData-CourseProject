The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and the 5 steps required for the course project.
Download the dataset
Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

Assign each data to variables
features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
List of activities performed 
subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
contains test data of volunteer test subjects being observed
x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
contains recorded features test data
y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
contains test data of activities’code labels
subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
contains train data of volunteer subjects being observed
x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
contains recorded features train data
y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns
contains train data of activities’code labels

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
X (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
Y (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
Subject (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
Merged_Data (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() function

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
TidyData (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting Merged_Data, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

Labels the data set with descriptive variable names code column in TidyData renamed into activities

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
FinalData (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing TidyData taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
Export FinalData into FinalData.txt file.
